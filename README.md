# HFM_workspace
HappyFreeMan public workspace
It contains tinder movie application and express app with mock API for movie application. Made with React.js with Typescript,uses Theme-UI library fr styling. Linter, jest and cypress e2e are built in. This workspace oses github actions workflow that jest tests and lints movie app and if passed it will build and deploy it to gh-pages. I needed constant testing so there is version of github actions workflow that is set to execute on every push to main, alongside there is another action that triggers on pull request to main branch. Deploy is locked by user credentials. This APP has no external backend, current build on https://wojtek0126.github.io/HFM_workspace/ will be data blank. To test the cards please clone this repo, install deps, run nx serve api and run nx serve movies. Answers for extra questions:
