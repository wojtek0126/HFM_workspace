# HFM_workspace
This is my NX workspace.
It contains tinder movie application and express app with mock API for movie application. Made with React.js with Typescript, Theme-UI library has been used for styling. Linter, jest and cypress e2e are built in. Github actions workflow: I made three workflows, one just welcomes and lists the repo, second jest tests and lints movie app and if passed it will build and deploy it to gh-pages on push to main, third does the same on pull request to main branch. Deploy is locked by user credentials. This APP has no external backend, current build on https://wojtek0126.github.io/HFM_workspace/ will be data blank. To test movie cards please run locally: clone this repo, run nx serve api and run nx serve movies. Also, here are my answers for extra questions:   
1. Usage of context provider to decouple data fetching from presentation layer. https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-decouple-data-from-ui-in-react-d6b1516f4f0b and https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/04/15/react-context-data-provider-pattern/ 

2. How to test the logic for data fetching? Instruction for fetch jest testing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTZ-txdrHdY Overall principles for fetch data testing and unit testing: https://tech.travelaudience.com/how-to-test-asynchronous-data-fetching-on-a-react-component-ff2ee7433d71
